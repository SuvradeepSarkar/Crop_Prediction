# Crop_Prediction
 
The objective of our study is to provide a solution for Smart Agriculture by monitoring the agricultural field which can assist the farmers in increasing productivity to a great extent.
The proposed system applies machine learning and prediction algorithm like Multiple Linear Regression to identify the pattern among data and then process it as per input conditions.
This in turn will propose the best feasible crops according to given environmental conditions.
